## New haskell-lang.org

**April 26 2016**

*By the haskell-lang.org team: Chris Allen, Julie Moronuki, Michael Snoyman, Francesco Mazzoli, Sibi Prabakaran, Gabriel Gonzalez*

**TODO Include other members of the team**

We are happy to announce the launch of a new Haskell community nexus
site: http://haskell-lang.org/. This website is aimed at providing
modern best practices information for the Haskell programming
language, and in particular with providing the best possible new user
experience. The aim is to lower the barrier to getting started with
Haskell, and ultimately increase adoption of Haskell in the greater
programming community.

The launch of this website is paired with the launch of a number of
additional community resources to aid its growth:

* A [new Github organization](https://github.com/haskell-lang) (including [the code for the website itself](https://github.com/haskell-lang/haskell-lang))
* A [new subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell_lang)
* A new `#haskell-lang` IRC channel on Freenode
* A [new Twitter account](https://twitter.com/haskell_lang)

These community resources are open to all to discuss the contents of
the website, and more broadly how to make Haskell as welcoming a language, community, and
ecosystem as can be managed. We encourage all Haskellers to join, and
to take part in lively discussions of how to improve the state of the
art within Haskell.

As this community is just forming, now is the perfect time to get
involved. Post questions and comments on Reddit, Tweet to us, send
pull requests for the website, and open issues. This community will
become what you put into it, so help shape it from the beginning!

### Why a new site?

Since it is a common question in such statements, let us ask it
directly here: why create a new website instead of working to
incrementally update haskell.org? In the opinion of the team
behind haskell-lang.org, the tooling story and general ecosystem
infrastructure for the Haskell community has accumulated enough
baggage that a clean break is the best use of everybody's
time. We intend to streamline the on-boarding process for new
developers, move away from infrastructure that is showing its
age, and embrace newer approaches to facilitate open
collaboration. Similar decisions have already been made in
creating the [Stack build tool](http://haskellstack.com/) and
[Stackage](https://www.stackage.org/).
